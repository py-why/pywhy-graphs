        "\n# On PAGs and their validity\n\nA PAG or a Partial Ancestral Graph is a type of mixed edge\ngraph that can represent, in a single graph, the causal relationship\nbetween several nodes as defined by an equivalence class of MAGs.\n\nPAGs account for possible unobserved confounding and selection bias\nin the underlying equivalence class of SCMs.\n\nAnother way to understand this is that PAGs encode conditional independence\nconstraints stemming from Causal Graphs. Since these constraints do not lead to a\nunique graph, a PAG, in essence, represents a class of graphs that encode\nthe same conditional independence constraints.\n\nPAGs model this relationship by displaying all common edge marks (tail and arrowhead) shared \nby all members in the equivalence class and displaying circle endpoints for those marks\nthat are not common. That is, a circular endpoint (``*-o``) can represent both a directed\n(``*->``) and tail (``*\u2014``) endpoint in causal graphs within the equivalence class.\n\nMore details on PAGs can be found at :footcite:`Zhang2008`.\n"
