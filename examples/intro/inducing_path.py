======================================================
An introduction to Inducing Paths and how to find them
======================================================

A path p is called an ``inducing path`` relative to <L,S>
on an mixed-edge graph with directed and bidirected edges, where every non-endpoint vertex on p
is either in L or a collider, and every collider on p is an ancestor
of either X , Y or a member of S.


In other words, it is a path between two nodes that cannot be
d-seperated, making it active regardless of what variables
we condition on.

More details on inducing paths can be found at :footcite:`Zhang2008`.

# %%
# Inducing paths between non-adjacent nodes
# ------------------------------------------
# Given the definition of an inducing path, we need to satisfy all
# requirements for the function to return True. Adding the latent
# variables to L is not enough for the pair [X1,X5]. As we see in
# Figure 2(c) in :footcite:`Colombo2012`,  (X1, X5) are not adjacent
# in the final skeleton of the equivalence class, which makes sense
# because a MAG is an equivalence class of a DAG and contains an
# edge among two nodes if i) the two nodes are adjacent in the DAG,
# or ii) the two nodes have a primitive inducing path between them.
# Since there is no adjacency among (X1, X5) in the final skeleton,
# there is no primitive inducing path between them.

L = {"L1", "L2"}
S = {}


# returns False
print(pywhy_graphs.inducing_path(G, "X1", "X5", L, S))


# However, if we add X3, a non-collider on the path
# from X1 to X5 to L, we make a valid inducing path.


L = {"L1", "L2", "X3"}
S = {}

# now it returns True
print(pywhy_graphs.inducing_path(G, "X1", "X5", L, S))


# %%
# The role of colliders
# ----------------------
# Adding colliders to the set S has a downstream effect.
# Conditioning on a collider, or descendant of a collider opens up that collider path.
# For example, we will add the node 'X6' to the set ``S``. This will make the
# path ``(X1, X2, X3)`` a valid inducing path, since 'X2' is an ancestor of 'X6'.

# Some node pairs still do not have a valid inducing path between them.
# For example, the path between X1 and X3 is not available.

# this returns False
print(pywhy_graphs.inducing_path(G, "X1", "X3", L, S))

# If we add X6 to ``S``, paths containing all the collider ancestors of X6
# will be valid inducing paths.
# Since X2 is a collider and an ancestor of X6, there should be a valid inducing
# path from X1 to X3 now.

L = {"L1", "L2", "X3"}
S = {"X6"}

# now it returns True
print(pywhy_graphs.inducing_path(G, "X1", "X3", L, S))
