===========================
On PAGs and their validity
===========================

A PAG or a Partial Ancestral Graph is a type of mixed edge
graph that can represent, in a single graph, the causal relationship
between several nodes as defined by an equivalence class of MAGs.

PAGs account for possible unobserved confounding and selection bias
in the underlying equivalence class of SCMs.

Another way to understand this is that PAGs encode conditional independence
constraints stemming from Causal Graphs. Since these constraints do not lead to a
unique graph, a PAG, in essence, represents a class of graphs that encode
the same conditional independence constraints.

PAGs model this relationship by displaying all common edge marks (tail and arrowhead) shared 
by all members in the equivalence class and displaying circle endpoints for those marks
that are not common. That is, a circular endpoint (``*-o``) can represent both a directed
(``*->``) and tail (``*â€”``) endpoint in causal graphs within the equivalence class.

More details on PAGs can be found at :footcite:`Zhang2008`.

# PAGs in pywhy-graphs
# ---------------------------
# Constructing a PAG in pywhy-graphs is an easy task since
# the library provides a separate class for this purpose.
# True to the definition of PAGs, the class can contain
# directed edges, bidirected edges, undirected edges and
# cicle edges. To illustrate this, we construct an example PAG
# as described in :footcite:`Zhang2008`, figure 4:

pag = PAG()
pag.add_edge("I", "S", pag.directed_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("G", "S", pag.directed_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("G", "L", pag.directed_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("S", "L", pag.directed_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("PSH", "S", pag.directed_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("S", "PSH", pag.circle_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("S", "G", pag.circle_edge_name)
pag.add_edge("S", "I", pag.circle_edge_name)


# Finally, the graph looks like this:
dot_graph = draw(pag)
dot_graph.render(outfile="valid_pag.png", view=True)


# %%
# Validity of a PAG
# ---------------------------
# For a PAG to be valid, it must represent a valid
# equivalent class of MAGs. This can be verified by
# turning the PAG into an MAG and then checking the
# validity of the MAG.
# Theorem 2 in :footcite:`Zhang2008` provides a method for checking the validity of a PAG.
# To check if the constructed PAG is a valid one in pywhy-graphs, we can simply do:


# returns True
print(pywhy_graphs.valid_pag(pag))

# %%
# If we want to test whether this algorithm is working correctly or not, we can change
# a single mark in the graph such that the PAG. By removing a circle edge, we are removing
# the representation of multiple marks as encoded by the different MAGs this PAG represents.
# In this specific case, by removing the circle endpoint ``S *-o I``, we are saying that ``S``
# directly causes ``I``. However, there is no way of determining this using the FCI logical rules.
# One would not be able to determine that the adjacency is due to a direct
# causal relationship (directed edge), confounded relationship (bidirected edge), or an inducing path
# relationship. As such, the resulting graph is no longer a valid PAG.

pag.remove_edge("S", "I", pag.circle_edge_name)

# returns False
print(pywhy_graphs.valid_pag(pag))
