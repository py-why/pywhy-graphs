**pywhy-graphs**
===================

pywhy-graphs is a Python package for representing causal graphs. For example, Acyclic
Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMG), also known as causal DAGs and Partial Ancestral Graphs (PAGs).
We build on top of ``networkx's`` ``MixedEdgeGraph`` such that we maintain all the well-tested and efficient
algorithms and data structures of ``networkx``. 

See our examples for walk-throughs of how to use the package.

We encourage you to use the package for your causal inference research and also build on top
with relevant Pull Requests. Also, see our `contributing guide <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-icalabel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
