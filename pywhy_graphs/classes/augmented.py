        Set of augmented nodes (i.e. F and S nodes).

    Notes
    -----
    F-nodes are just nodes that are added to a causal graph, and
    represent an "augmentation" of the original causal graph to handle
    interventions. Each F-node is mapped to a 2-tuple representing the
    index pair of intervention-targets.

    If the intervention targets are unknown, then the 2-tuple contains
    integer indices representing the index of an interventional distribution.
    This is called :math:`\\sigma` in :footcite:`Jaber2020causal`.

    **Edge Type Subgraphs**

    Different edge types in an AugmentedPAG are represented exactly as they are in a
    :class:`pywhy_graphs.PAG`.

    **F-nodes**

    Interventions are represented by special nodes, known as F-nodes. See
    :footcite:`Jaber2020causal`, or :footcite:`Kocaoglu2019characterization` for details.

    F-nodes are represented in pywhy-graphs as a tuple as ``('F', <index>)``, where ``index``
    is just a random index number. Each F-node is mapped to the intervention-set that they
    are applied on. For example in the graph :math:`('F', 0) \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y`,
    ``('F', 0)`` is the F-node added that models an intervention on ``X``. Each intervention-set
    is a set of regular nodes in the causal graph.

    **S-nodes**

    Different domains and environments are represented by special nodes, known as S-nodes. See
    :footcite:`bareinboim_causal_2016` for details.

    S-nodes are represented in pywhy-graphs as a tuple as ``('S', <index>)``, where ``index``
    is just a random index number. Each F-node is mapped to the intervention-set that they
    are applied on. For example in the graph :math:`('F', 0) \\rightarrow X \\rightarrow Y`,
    ``('F', 0)`` is the F-node added that models an intervention on ``X``. Each intervention-set
