class CPDAG(pywhy_nx.MixedEdgeGraph, AncestralMixin, ConservativeMixin):
    """Completed partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAG).

    CPDAGs generalize causal DAGs by allowing undirected edges.
    Undirected edges imply uncertainty in the orientation of the causal
    relationship. For example, ``A - B``, can be ``A -> B`` or ``A <- B``,
    allowing for a Markov equivalence class of DAGs for each CPDAG.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming_directed_edges : input directed edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize directed edges. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.DiGraph` are accepted.
    incoming_undirected_edges : input undirected edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize undirected edges. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.Graph` are accepted.
    directed_edge_name : str
        The name for the directed edges. By default 'directed'.
    undirected_edge_name : str
        The name for the directed edges. By default 'undirected'.
    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    Notes
    -----
    CPDAGs are Markov equivalence class of causal DAGs. The implicit assumption in
    these causal graphs are the Structural Causal Model (or SCM) is Markovian, inducing
    causal sufficiency, where there is no unobserved latent confounder. This allows CPDAGs
    to be learned from score-based (such as the "GES" algorithm) and constraint-based
    (such as the PC algorithm) approaches for causal structure learning.

    One should not use CPDAGs if they suspect their data has unobserved latent confounders.

    **Edge Type Subgraphs**

    The data structure underneath the hood is stored in two networkx graphs:
    ``networkx.Graph`` and ``networkx.DiGraph`` to represent the non-directed
    edges and directed edges. Non-directed edges in an CPDAG can be present as
    undirected edges standing for uncertainty in which directino the directed
    edge is in.

    - Directed edges (<-, ->, indicating causal relationship) = `networkx.DiGraph`
        The subgraph of directed edges may be accessed by the
        :meth:`sub_directed_graph`. Their edges in networkx format can be
        accessed by :attr:`directed_edges` and the corresponding name of the
        edge type by :attr:`directed_edge_name`.
    - Undirected edges (--, indicating uncertainty) = `networkx.Graph`
        The subgraph of undirected edges may be accessed by the
        :meth:`sub_undirected_graph`. Their edges in networkx format can be
        accessed by :attr:`undirected_edges` and the corresponding name of the
        edge type by :attr:`undirected_edge_name`.

    By definition, no cycles may exist due to the directed edges.
