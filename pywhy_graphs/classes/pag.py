    """Partial ancestral graph (PAG).

    PAGs are a Markov equivalence class with mixed edges of directed,
    bidirected, undirected and edges with circle endpoints. In terms
    of graph functionality, they essentially extend the definition of
    an ADMG with edges with circular endpoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming_directed_edges : input directed edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize directed edges. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.DiGraph` are accepted.
    incoming_undirected_edges : input undirected edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize undirected edges. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.Graph` are accepted.
    incoming_bidirected_edges : input bidirected edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize bidirected edges. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.Graph` are accepted.
    incoming_circle_edges : input circular endpoint edges (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize edges with circle endpoints. All arguments that are accepted
        by `networkx.DiGraph` are accepted.
    directed_edge_name : str
        The name for the directed edges. By default 'directed'.
    undirected_edge_name : str
        The name for the undirected edges. By default 'undirected'.
    bidirected_edge_name : str
        The name for the bidirected edges. By default 'bidirected'.
    circle_edge_name : str
        The name for the circle edges. By default 'circle'.
    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    Notes
    -----
    CPDAGs are Markov equivalence class of causal DAGs. The implicit assumption in
    these causal graphs are the Structural Causal Model (or SCM) is Markovian, inducing
    causal sufficiency, where there is no unobserved latent confounder. This allows CPDAGs
    to be learned from score-based (such as the "GES" algorithm) and constraint-based
    (such as the PC algorithm) approaches for causal structure learning.

    One should not use CPDAGs if they suspect their data has unobserved latent confounders.
