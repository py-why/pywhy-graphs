def is_valid_cg(graph: CG):
    """
    Checks if a supplied chain graph is valid.

    This implements the original definition of a (Lauritzen Wermuth Frydenberg) chain graph as
    presented in [1]_.

    Define a cycle as a series of nodes X_1 -o X_2 ... X_n -o X_1 where the edges may be directed or
    undirected. Note that directed edges in a cycle must all be aligned in the same direction. A
    chain graph may only contain cycles consisting of only undirected edges. Equivalently, a chain
    graph does not contain any cycles with one or more directed edges.

    Parameters
    __________
    graph : CG
        The graph.

    Returns
    _______
    is_valid : bool
        Whether supplied `graph` is a valid chain graph.
