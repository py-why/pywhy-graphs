    In a pd path, the edge between V(i) and V(i+1) is not an arrowhead into V(i)
    or a tail from V(i+1). An intuitive explanation given in :footcite:`Zhang2008`
    notes that a pd path could be oriented into a directed path by changing circles
    into tails or arrowheads.

    In addition, the path is uncovered, meaning every node beside the endpoints are unshielded,
    meaning V(i-1) and V(i+1) are not adjacent.

    A special case of a uncovered pd path is an uncovered circle path, which appears
    as u o-o ... o-o c.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : PAG
        PAG to orient.
    u : node
        A node in the graph to start the uncovered path.
    c : node
        A node in the graph.
    max_path_length : optional, int
        The maximum distance to check in the graph. By default None, which sets
        it to 1000.
    first_node : node, optional
        The node previous to 'u'. If it is before 'u', then we will check
        that 'u' is unshielded. If it is not passed, then 'u' is considered
        the first node in the path and hence does not need to be unshielded.
        Both 'first_node' and 'second_node' cannot be passed.
    second_node : node, optional
        The node after 'u' that the path must traverse. Both 'first_node'
        and 'second_node' cannot be passed.
    force_circle: bool
        Whether to search for only circle paths (u o-o ... o-o c) or all
        potentially directed paths. By default False, which searches for all potentially
        directed paths.
    forbid_node: node, optional
        A node after 'u' which is forbidden to immediately traverse when searching for a path.

    Notes
    -----
    The definition of an uncovered pd path is taken from :footcite:`Zhang2008`.

    Typically uncovered potentially directed paths are defined by two nodes. However,
    in one use case within the FCI algorithm, it is defined relative
    to an adjacent third node that comes before 'u'.

    In certain cases (e.g. R5 of FCI) an uncovered pd path must be found between two variables,
    but these variables are already adjacent and connected by a trivial uncovered pd path.
    To prevent the function from returning this trivial path, the 'forbid_node' argument can be
    used.

    A partial ancestral graph (PAG) is defined with directed edges (``->``), bidirected edges
    (``<->``), and circle-endpoint edges (``o-*``, where the ``*`` for example can mean an
    arrowhead from a directed edge).

    This algorithm implements the definite m-separation check, which checks for the absence of
    possibly m-connecting paths between 'x' and 'y' given 'z'.

    This algorithm first obtains the ancestral subgraph of x | y | z which only requires knowledge
    of the directed edges. Then, all outgoing directed edges from nodes in z are deleted. After
    that, an undirected graph composed from the directed and bidirected edges amongst the
    remaining nodes is created. Then, x is independent of y given z if x is disconnected from y
    in this new graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : mixed-edge-graph
        Mixed edge causal graph.
    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.
    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.
    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.
