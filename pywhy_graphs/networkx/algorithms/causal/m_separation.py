def m_separated(G, x, y, z, bidirected_edge_name="bidirected", directed_edge_name="directed"):
    """Check m-separation among 'x' and 'y' given 'z' in mixed-edge causal graph G.

    This algorithm adapts the linear time algorithm presented in [1]_ currently implemented in
    `networkx.algorithms.d_separation` to work for mixed-edge causal graphs.

    This algorithm first obtains the ancestral subgraph of x | y | z which only requires knowledge
    of the directed edges. Then, all outgoing directed edges from nodes in z are deleted. After
    that, an undirected graph composed from the directed and bidirected edges amongst the
    remaining nodes is created. Then, x is independent of y given z if x is disconnected from y
    in this new graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : mixed-edge-graph
        Mixed edge causal graph.
    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.
    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.
    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if ``x`` is m-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.

    This wraps the networkx implementation, which only allows DAGs. Since
    ``ADMG`` is not represented.
